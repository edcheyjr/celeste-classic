Follow along as we venture into uncharted territory, crafting an exciting gaming experience.

## Progress

- [ ] Post on Twitter, Medium, YouTube, and my blog
- [ ] Break - Take a breather 😮‍💨
- [ ]Custom Level design UI. something like a table where you can visual design level then that is translated to the 1D array used to make the levels
